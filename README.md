## 🚀 Getting Started – Run Locally

### ✅ Prerequisites

Make sure you have:

* Linux-based OS
* GCC compiler
* Bash or Zsh shell
* Basic terminal knowledge

---

### ⚙️ Setup Instructions

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Tusharxhub/Operating_system.git
cd Operating_system
```

---

## ▶️ How to Run Programs

### Compile and Run C Programs

```bash
gcc program.c -o program
./program
```

### Run Shell Scripts

```bash
chmod +x script.sh
./script.sh
```

---

## 🖥️ Example Output

### Example: Running a C Program

```bash
$ ./Main
Enter an integer: 4
Output: 16
```

### Example: Shell Script Execution

```bash
$ ./process_check.sh
Process started successfully
PID: 2154
```

These outputs help verify correct execution and improve understanding of OS-level behavior.

## 📖 Learning Approach

* Read inline comments carefully
* Modify inputs to observe behavior changes
* Use tools like `top`, `htop`, `ps`, and `strace`
* Compare outcomes with OS theory

This repository is ideal for **lab exams**, **revision**, and **concept strengthening**.
