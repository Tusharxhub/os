---

## ✨ Key Concepts Covered

- 🧾 Shell scripting and automation  
- 🔀 Conditional statements (`if-else`, `case`)  
- 🔁 Looping constructs (`for`, `while`)  
- 🧮 Arithmetic and floating-point operations  
- ✅ Input validation and error handling  
- 📁 File handling and permissions  
- 🔍 Linux commands and system utilities  
- 🧪 OS lab-style experiments  

Each program is designed to connect **theory with real system behavior**.

## 🚀 Getting Started – Run Locally

### ✅ Prerequisites

Make sure you have:

* Linux-based OS (Fedora / Ubuntu recommended)
* Bash or Zsh shell
* `bc` calculator (for float arithmetic scripts — install via `sudo apt install bc` or `sudo dnf install bc`)
* Basic terminal knowledge

---

### ⚙️ Setup Instructions

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Tusharxhub/Operating_system.git
cd Operating_system
```

---

## ▶️ How to Run Programs

### Run Shell Scripts

```bash
# Make the script executable (one-time)
chmod +x "Day 1/Main.sh"

# Run it
bash "Day 1/Main.sh"
```

---

## 🖥️ Example Output

### Even / Odd Check (Day 1)

```bash
$ bash "Day 1/Main.sh"
Enter an integer: 7
7 is odd.
```

### Leap Year Check (Day 2)

```bash
$ bash "Day 2/Year.sh"
Enter a year: 2024
2024 is a leap year.
```

### Prime Number Check (Day 3)

```bash
$ bash "Day 3/Prime.sh"
Enter a number: 13
13 is a prime number.
```

## 📖 Learning Approach

* Read inline comments carefully — each script documents its purpose and usage
* Modify inputs to observe behavior changes
* Use tools like `top`, `htop`, `ps`, and `strace`
* Compare outcomes with OS theory

This repository is ideal for **lab exams**, **revision**, and **concept strengthening**.
